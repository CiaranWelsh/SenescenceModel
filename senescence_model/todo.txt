List of things to do within the agent based senescent model
===========================================================
- Build analytic functions for plotting
- Custom visualisation, following instructions from github question
- Remember to answer github question with a thank you
- Modify visualisation to:
	- Use separate vertex shaders for both agents
	- Convert Tissue agent to a cube shape
	- See if I can use cuda for getting unique IDs for each new fibroblast generated
	- build in mechanism for modifying parameters and restarting simulation during the visualisation
- Add boundaries to where the fibroblasts can move
- put all starting fibroblasts within the cube
