Brief Model Description
=======================
- Model to simulate the contribution of senescent fibroblasts to damaged tissue. 

Agents
======
- Tissue. Discrete blocks with 'tunable' volume for fine or coarse graining simulations. 
- Fibroblasts. Migrate towards and repair damaged tissue. Fibroblasts are superimposed on tissue blocks in contineous space.

Fibroblast states
=================
- Quiescent
- Senescent
- early Senescent

Tissue states
=============
- Only 1 state (default), but contains a 'damage' global variable.
 
 Initial cond
============
- Simulation is seeded with proportion of fibrobastls early senescent (calculated from probabilities based on 10000 simulations of Piero's )

Tissue Behaviour
================
- Tissue has a random chance of being damaged (+1 damage). This is discrete global variable and can take on integer values up to 100. 
- Damaged tissue can be fixed by quiescent fibroblasts

Fibroblast Behaviour
====================

When Quiescent
-------------- 
- Quiescent cells may migrate around the tissue (potentially towards damaged tissue) 
- Quiescent cells may undergo transition to early senescent if a cell near it is senescent cell
- Quiescent cells may proliferate
- Should quiescent cells have a basal rate of apoptosis?

When early senescent
--------------------  
- Early senescent fibroblasts begin counting time units. 
  When predefined threshold is reached (either 10 days or normally distributed around 10 days), early -> full senescence
- Early senescent cells have a chance (probability) of being cleared, and they are removed from the simulation
 
When senescent
-------------- 
- Once fully senescent, there is no repairation.
- should fully senescent cells die eventually or just stick around?
- do senescent cells algo migrate around tissue like quiescent?
